# GAME-NIGHT HACKS FOR ADMINS
## 1. Prepare the list of invites before the Game Night
You can utilized different applications to assign each invite to a specific group,
#note that you only have to group people who don't have a group yet / VIPS

### 1.A Turn your list into a table so its easy to see which person belongs to a group: 
EXAMPLE: 
1. Jacob           8. Alyanna
2. Diane           9. Jazmine
3. Claire          10. Darlene
4. Kyle            11. James
5. Reig            12. John
6. Gabbi 
7. Shannel

### Convert it into 

|TEAM ALYANNA | TEAM JAZMINE | TEAM SHANNEL |
| ----------  | -----------  | ------------ |
| Jacob       | Kyle         | Reig         |
| Diane       | Darlene      | Claire       |
| Gabbi       | Peter        | James        |


In this way it would be easy for you to know which group to assign them.
Also if there is any imbalance in a group, you can always change the _groupings
so that each group has equal number of participants

## 2. BREAKOUT ROOMS IN ZOOM 
Once people are joining the breakout room you can start making the rooms by clicking the breakout room
option _THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU ARE THE MAIN HOST_ so make sure you get permission first.
